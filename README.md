Dynamic Programming – Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) & Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
This project implements multiple dynamic-programming solutions in Python for computing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), including algorithms for calculating the sequence length, the total number of optimal subsequences, and retrieving all distinct optimal subsequences up to a configurable limit teta. The implementation constructs and traverses DP tables, explores alternative backtracking paths for sequence reconstruction, and applies graph-based DFS to enumerate unique subsequences. The project also includes full time-complexity analysis and reasoning for each algorithm.
